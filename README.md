# Crafty Controller 4.0.16
> Python based Control Panel for your Minecraft Server

## What is Crafty Controller?
Crafty Controller is a Minecraft Server Control Panel / Launcher. The purpose
of Crafty Controller is to launch a Minecraft Server in the background and present
a web interface for the server administrators to interact with their servers. Crafty
is compatible with Docker, Linux, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10.

## Basic Docker Usage 🐳

With `Crafty Controller 4.0` we have focused on building our DevOps Principles, implementing build automation, and securing our containers, with the hopes of making our Container user's lives abit easier.

### - Two big changes you will notice is:
- We now provide pre-built images for you guys.
- Containers now run as non-root, using practices used by OpenShift & Kubernetes (root group perms).


> __**⚠ 🔻WARNING: [WSL/WSL2 | WINDOWS 11 | DOCKER DESKTOP]🔻**__ <br>
 BE ADVISED! Upstream is currently broken for Minecraft running on **Docker under WSL/WSL2, Windows 11 / DOCKER DESKTOP!** <br>
 On '**Stop**' or '**Restart**' of the MC Server, there is a 90% chance the World's Chunks will be shredded irreparably! <br>
 Please only run Docker on Linux, If you are using Windows we have a portable installs found here: [Latest-Stable](https://gitlab.com/crafty-controller/crafty-4/-/releases), [Latest-Development](https://gitlab.com/crafty-controller/crafty-4/-/jobs/artifacts/dev/download?job=win-dev-build)

----

### - To get started with docker 🛫
All you need to do is pull the image from this git repository's registry.
This is done by using `'docker-compose'` or `'docker run'` (You don't need to clone the Repository and build, like in 3.x ).

If you have a config folder already from previous local installation or _docker setup_*, the image should mount this volume and fix the permission as required, if no config present then it will populate its own config folder for you. <br> <br>
As the Dockerfile uses the permission structure of `crafty:root` **internally** there is no need to worry about matching the `UID` or `GID` on the host system :)

<br>

### - Using the registry image 🌎
The provided image supports both `arm64` and `amd64` out the box, if you have issues though you can build it yourself with the `compose` file in `docker/`.

The image is located at: `registry.gitlab.com/crafty-controller/crafty-4:latest`

<br>

**Here are some example methods for getting started🚀:**

### **docker-compose.yml:**
```sh
# Make your compose file
$ vim docker-compose.yml
```
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  crafty:
    container_name: crafty_container
    image: registry.gitlab.com/crafty-controller/crafty-4:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    ports:
      - "8000:8000" # HTTP
      - "8443:8443" # HTTPS
      - "8123:8123" # DYNMAP
      - "19132:19132/udp" # BEDROCK
      - "25500-25600:25500-25600" # MC SERV PORT RANGE
    volumes:
      - ./docker/backups:/crafty/backups
      - ./docker/logs:/crafty/logs
      - ./docker/servers:/crafty/servers
      - ./docker/config:/crafty/app/config
      - ./docker/import:/crafty/import
```
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
```
<br>

### **docker run:**
```sh
$ docker run \
	--name crafty_container \
	--detach \
	--restart always \
	-p 8000:8000 \
	-p 8443:8443 \
	-p 8123:8123 \
	-p 19132:19132/udp \
	-p 25500-25600:25500-25600 \
	-e TZ=Etc/UTC \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/backups:/crafty/backups" \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/logs:/crafty/logs" \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/servers:/crafty/servers" \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/config:/crafty/app/config" \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/import:/crafty/import" \
	registry.gitlab.com/crafty-controller/crafty-4:latest
```

### **Building from the cloned repository:**

If you are building from `docker-compose` you can find the compose file in `./docker/docker-compose.yml` just `cd` to the docker directory and `docker-compose up -d`

If you'd rather not use `docker-compose` you can use the following `docker run` in the directory where the *Dockerfile* is:
```sh
# REMEMBER, Build your image first!
$ docker build . -t crafty

$ docker run \
	--name crafty_container \
	--detach \
	--restart always \
	-p 8000:8000 \
	-p 8443:8443 \
	-p 8123:8123 \
	-p 19132:19132/udp \
	-p 25500-25600:25500-25600 \
	-e TZ=Etc/UTC \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/backups:/crafty/backups" \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/logs:/crafty/logs" \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/servers:/crafty/servers" \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/config:/crafty/app/config" \
	-v "/$(pwd)/docker/import:/crafty/import" \
	crafty
```
A fresh build will take several minutes depending on your system, but will be rapid thereafter.
